# auto-apply-for-jobs

I am automating parts of applying for jobs Python and Selenium. So far, I have mostly automated applying for data analyst jobs on Indeed that let me apply with my Indeed resume. Although, I may not add to my program so that it will apply for jobs elsewhere, I wrote it so that it would be easy to add functionalities.  

I could not automate solving Google's recaptca immage puzzle. I also did not feel the need to because I still want to double check that a job is appropriate. I did take efforts to not just spam companies with my resume.
